        <h1>H_ART THE BAND</h1>
        <P>
            H_art the band is made up of three members. Mordecai Mwinyi who is the 
            lead singer, Wachira Gatama who is the poet and Kenneth Muya, the guitarist.
            The journey to the top was no walk in the park. They were set book actors, 
            except Mordecai, at the Kenya National Theatre and performed in other small plays.
            Although they earned a few coins, they felt they needed to switch to music. At first
            the plan was for Mordecai to sing as Kenneth plays the piano but they decided to bring 
            Wachira, who is more of a poet, on board and theyâ€™ve never looked back. The three 
            became a team when they auditioned for a cancer awareness play at the Kenya National
            Theatre late in 2012.In 2013 they sang a political song and thereafter came up with 
            their name H_art the band.They signed a deal with Penya records and were enrolled in Sauti 
            Sol Academy. Little by little, they grew as a band and started performing in gigs.
